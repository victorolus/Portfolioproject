## Project Structure

The project includes:

1. **Data Analysis using SQLite, Tableau CRM Data Visualization, Temporal Trends Graph, Key SQL Queries**
   - In-depth SQL queries were executed on a dataset with 300,000+ rows.
   - Techniques such as CTEs, Temporary Tables, Window Functions, and Aggregate Functions were implemented.
   - Utilized Tableau CRM to create visually appealing and interactive visualizations.
   - Examined global numbers, continent-wise mortality, and population impact.
   - Analyzed temporal trends and performed forecasting.
   - Created an interactive Mapbox visualization reflecting global infection rates.
   - Users can explore infection rates by location with color intensity indicating the severity.
   - Designed a Tableau table illustrating global statistics, including the percentage of the world population infected (0.891%).
   - Constructed a bar chart illustrating total deaths per continent, emphasizing variations between continents.
   - Developed a line graph showcasing the average percentage of the population infected over time, with a forecast for future expectations.
