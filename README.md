## Project Structure

The project includes:

1. **Data Analysis using SQLite:**
   - In-depth SQL queries were executed on a dataset with 300,000+ rows.
   - Techniques such as CTEs, Temporary Tables, Window Functions, and Aggregate Functions were implemented.

2. **Tableau CRM Data Visualization:**
   - Utilized Tableau CRM to create visually appealing and interactive visualizations.

3. **Key SQL Queries:**
   - Examined global numbers, continent-wise mortality, and population impact.
   - Analyzed temporal trends and performed forecasting.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - **Mapbox Interaction:**
     - Created an interactive Mapbox visualization reflecting global infection rates.
   - Users can explore infection rates by location with color intensity indicating the severity.

   - **Global Numbers Table:**
     - Designed a Tableau table illustrating global statistics, including the percentage of the world population infected (0.891%).

   - **Temporal Trends Graph:**
     - Developed a line graph showcasing the average percentage of the population infected over time, with a forecast for future expectations.

   - **Continent-wise Mortality Bar Chart:**
     - Constructed a bar chart illustrating total deaths per continent, emphasizing variations between continents.

## Technologies Used
